                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Vaibhav Mullasseriyil Chirag. But I prefer people calling me Vaibhav or Peter. I was born in a place called Uliyanadu, located in Kerala state in India. I have a younger brother. His name is Vihan. I have a pet dog back at home. I also had a lot of pet fishes.</p>
                <p>I went to a school called <em>Vimala Central School</em>. I completed my highschool from there. I have done three shortfilms while in 11<sup>th</sup> grade and got two firsts and a second position. My hobbies are editing photos and videos, and watching anime. My ambition is to become a <em><abbr title="Visual Effects">VFX</abbr> artist</em>. </p>
